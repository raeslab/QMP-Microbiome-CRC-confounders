# Repository Name: Microbiome Analysis Pipeline

This repository contains a comprehensive pipeline for analyzing microbiome data from the LCMP cohort. The pipeline covers a range of analyses including data preprocessing, quality control, taxonomic profiling, statistical analysis, and visualization. Below is a detailed guide on how to use the pipeline for each step of the analysis.

## 1. Downloading fastq files and grouping them by sequencing batches

To begin the analysis, the first step is to download the fastq files from the repository. Make sure you have the necessary permissions and access to the metadata. Once you have the fastq files, group them by sequencing batches for easy management and analysis. Use the following steps:

1. Create a directory structure to organize your data, such as `data/raw_data/` for storing the raw fastq files.
2. Place the fastq files in the corresponding sequencing batch directories within the `data/raw_data/` directory.
3. Make sure to appropriately name the directories to reflect the sequencing batches and include relevant metadata if available.

## 2. Initial analysis using dada2 to obtain ASV (per sequencing batch)

After the fastq files have been grouped into sequencing batches, the next step is to perform initial analysis using the dada2 package to obtain Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) for each sequencing batch. Follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies, including R and the dada2 package.
2. Create a script, such as `scripts/dada2_analysis.R`, and load the necessary libraries.
3. Write code to read and process the fastq files using the dada2 pipeline.
4. Perform quality filtering, trimming, denoising, and chimera removal using the dada2 functions.
5. Save the obtained ASVs for each sequencing batch to separate output files, preferably in a directory structure such as `data/processed_data/ASVs_per_batch/`.

## 3. Filtering unclassified and non-bacterial ASVs

Once you have obtained the ASVs for each sequencing batch, it is important to filter out unclassified and non-bacterial ASVs to focus on the microbial taxa of interest. Follow these steps:

1. Create a script, such as `scripts/ASV_filtering.R`, and load the necessary libraries.
2. Read the ASV files for each sequencing batch from the `data/processed_data/ASVs_per_batch/` directory.
3. Implement filtering criteria to remove unclassified and non-bacterial ASVs based on taxonomic annotations.
4. Save the filtered ASVs for each sequencing batch to new output files, preferably in a directory structure such as `data/processed_data/Filtered_ASVs_per_batch/`.

## 4. Exploratory and quality control analysis

After filtering the ASVs, it is essential to perform exploratory and quality control analyses to gain insights into the dataset. Follow these steps:

1. Create a script, such as `scripts/exploratory_analysis.R`, and load the necessary libraries.
2. Read the filtered ASV files for each sequencing batch from the `data/processed_data/Filtered_ASVs_per_batch/` directory.
3. Conduct exploratory analyses such as alpha diversity, beta diversity, and taxonomic composition.
4. Generate quality control plots and summary statistics to assess the data quality and identify potential issues.
5. Save the exploratory analysis results and quality control plots in appropriate directories, such as `results/exploratory_analysis/` and `results/quality_control/`.

## 5. Quantitative Microbiome Profiling (QMP) at ASV level

Quantitative Microbiome Profiling (QMP) at the ASV level enables the quantification of microbial abundance. Follow these steps to perform QMP:

1. Create a script, such as `scripts/qmp_analysis.R`, and load the necessary libraries.
2. Read the filtered ASV files for each sequencing batch from the `data/processed_data/Filtered_ASVs_per_batch/` directory.
3. Aggregate the ASV counts across samples to obtain ASV-level abundance profiles.
4. Normalize the abundance data using appropriate methods such as rarefaction or cumulative sum scaling (CSS).
5. Perform statistical analyses and generate plots to compare the abundance profiles across different conditions or groups of interest.
6. Save the QMP results, normalized abundance data, and relevant visualizations in appropriate directories, such as `results/qmp_analysis/` and `results/abundance_plots/`.

## 6. Microbiota covariates identification

Identification of microbiota covariates helps in understanding the factors influencing microbial community composition. Follow these steps to identify microbiota covariates:

1. Create a script, such as `scripts/covariate_identification.R`, and load the necessary libraries.
2. Read the filtered ASV files for each sequencing batch from the `data/processed_data/Filtered_ASVs_per_batch/` directory.
3. Prepare the necessary metadata, such as sample characteristics, environmental factors, or clinical variables.
4. Perform appropriate statistical tests or modeling approaches to identify significant associations between covariates and microbial abundance.
5. Generate visualizations, such as heatmaps or bar plots, to illustrate the identified covariates.
6. Save the covariate identification results and relevant visualizations in appropriate directories, such as `results/covariate_identification/`.

## 7. Differential abundance analysis

To identify taxa showing differential abundance between different conditions or groups, follow these steps:

1. Create a script, such as `scripts/differential_abundance.R`, and load the necessary libraries.
2. Read the filtered ASV files for each sequencing batch from the `data/processed_data/Filtered_ASVs_per_batch/` directory.
3. Prepare the necessary metadata, specifying the conditions or groups for comparison.
4. Apply appropriate statistical tests, such as DESeq2 or edgeR, to identify differentially abundant ASVs.
5. Adjust for multiple testing and define significance thresholds.
6. Generate visualizations, such as volcano plots or heatmaps, to visualize the differential abundance results.
7. Save the differential abundance analysis results and relevant visualizations in appropriate directories, such as `results/differential_abundance/`.

## 8. Taxa abundance associations

Investigating associations between taxa abundance and other variables can provide valuable insights. Follow these steps to analyze taxa abundance associations:

1. Create a script, such as `scripts/abundance_associations.R`, and load the necessary libraries.
2. Read the filtered ASV files for each sequencing batch from the `data/processed_data/Filtered_ASVs_per_batch/` directory.
3. Prepare the necessary metadata, including variables of interest for association analysis.
4. Apply appropriate statistical tests or modeling approaches, such as correlation analysis or regression models, to identify associations between taxa abundance and the variables of interest.
5. Generate visualizations, such as scatter plots or box plots, to visualize the associations.
6. Save the abundance association analysis results and relevant visualizations in appropriate directories, such as `results/abundance_associations/`.

## 9. Linear model analysis

Linear model analysis helps in exploring relationships between multiple covariates and microbial abundance. Follow these steps to perform linear models analysis:

1. Create a script, such as `scripts/linear_models.R`, and load the necessary libraries.
2. Read the filtered ASV files for each sequencing batch from the `data/processed_data/Filtered_ASVs_per_batch/` directory.
3. Prepare the necessary

 metadata, including multiple covariates of interest.
4. Apply linear models or regression analysis to investigate the relationship between covariates and microbial abundance.
5. Perform appropriate statistical tests, assess model fit, and determine the significance of covariates.
6. Generate visualizations, such as coefficient plots or model summary tables, to interpret the results.
7. Save the linear models analysis results and relevant visualizations in appropriate directories, such as `results/linear_models_analysis/`.

## 10. Enterotyping

Enterotyping is a method to categorize individuals based on their gut microbiota composition. Follow these steps to perform enterotyping analysis:

1. Create a script, such as `scripts/enterotyping.R`, and load the necessary libraries.
2. Read the filtered ASV files for each sequencing batch from the `data/processed_data/Filtered_ASVs_per_batch/` directory.
3. Prepare the necessary metadata, including sample characteristics or clinical variables.
4. Apply dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), to identify enterotypes.
5. Visualize the enterotypes using scatter plots, bar plots, or other appropriate visualizations.
